# Getting Started 
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., AJSToken.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

# Explanation
mint(): Minting new tokens refers to the creation of new tokens and adding them to the total supply. This action is usually controlled by the contract owner or an authorized entity within the smart contract.

transferTokens(): Transferring tokens involves sending tokens from one address to another. This is a basic operation in an ERC20 token contract.

redeemTokens(): Redeeming tokens typically refers to the action of converting tokens back to some form of value, often in a scenario where tokens represent a redeemable asset. This action can vary widely depending on the use case of the token.

checkTokenBalance(): Checking the balance of tokens for a particular address is an essential feature in any ERC20 token contract.

burnTokens(): Burning tokens refers to the action of permanently removing tokens from the total supply. This is often done to reduce the total supply and can be initiated by the token holder or the contract owner.
